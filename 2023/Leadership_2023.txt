It was my first official day as the team leader on the team I had joined just 18
months earlier. The entire team was on-site for planning. I had started the
morning with a discussion on trust and respect and how we should be supporting
each other because even before I took over, there was some tension on the team
between a developer and the Business Analyst. 

We started planning and things were going well when I stepped out to join my
leader’s staff meeting. I left our BA in charge of running the meeting.  Within
15 minutes, I was receiving text messages from my team.

The first text message to arrive said

“U need to run planning. The hour after discussion about helping each other and
being respectful I get <redacted>. No matter what I ask or do. He just a dick
and will be the reason I leave this team. He just wants to be difficult for the
sake that he doesn’t want to do planning.

I can’t do this.”

I showed my leader my phone and we quickly adjourned his meeting so I could get
back to my team and figure out what was going on. The text messages continued as
I made my way over to where I had left them just 20 minutes earlier. What
happened over the next day or two had a huge impact on me as a leader and taught
me lessons I haven’t forgotten.

Good grief. Welcome to leadership, and welcome to my journey.

When I started giving this talk back in 2017, it had been less than a year since
that day. I thought I had things figured out, but since then, I have continued
to learn and grow as a leader. 

During the next (n minutes), I want to 
* Tell you about my journey
* Talk about my reasons for becoming a leader and for moving between the roles over time
* Give you an idea of the challenges I’ve experienced and how I’ve overcome some of them






After some bumps in the road, lots of introspecting...I feel like I'm finally starting to figure it out. 23 years after 
my first stint as a technical lead,
